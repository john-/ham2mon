class TunerDemodNBFM(BaseTuner):
    """Tuner, demodulator, and recorder chain for narrow band FM demodulation

    Kept as it's own class so multiple can be instantiated in parallel
    Accepts complex baseband samples at 1 Msps minimum
    Frequency translating FIR filter tunes from -samp_rate/2 to +samp_rate/2
    The following sample rates assume 1 Msps input
    First two stages of decimation are 5 each for a total of 25
    Thus first two stages brings 1 Msps down to 40 ksps
    The third stage decimates by int(samp_rate/1E6)
    Thus output rate will vary from 40 ksps to 79.99 ksps
    The channel is filtered to 12.5 KHz bandwidth followed by squelch
    The squelch is non-blocking since samples will be added with other demods
    The quadrature demod is followed by a fourth stage of decimation by 5
    This brings the sample rate down to 8 ksps to 15.98 ksps
    The audio is low-pass filtered to 3.5 kHz bandwidth
    The polyphase resampler resamples by samp_rate/(decims[1] * decims[0]**3)
    This results in a constant 8 ksps, irrespective of RF sample rate
    This 8 ksps audio stream may be added to other demod streams
    The audio is run through an additional blocking squelch at -200 dB
    This stops the sample flow so squelched audio is not recorded to file
    The wav file sink stores 8-bit samples (default/grainy quality but compact)
    Default demodulator center frequency is 0 Hz
    This is desired since hardware DC removal reduces sensitivity at 0 Hz
    NBFM demod of LO leakage will just be 0 amplitude

    Args:
        samp_rate (int): Input baseband sample rate in sps (1E6 minimum)
        audio_rate (int): Output audio sample rate in sps (8 kHz minimum)
        record (bool): Record audio to file if True
        audio_bps (int): Audio bit depth in bps (bits/samples)
        min_recording (float): Minimum length of a recording in seconds

    Attributes:
        center_freq (int): Baseband center frequency in Hz
        record (bool): Record audio to file if True
