    """Tuner, demodulator, and recorder chain for wide band FM demodulation

    Kept as it's own class so multiple can be instantiated in parallel
    Accepts complex baseband samples at 1 Msps minimum
    Frequency translating FIR filter tunes from -samp_rate/2 to +samp_rate/2
    The following sample rates assume 1 Msps input
    First two stages of decimation are 4 each for a total of 16
    Thus first two stages brings 1 Msps down to 40 ksps
    The third stage decimates by int(samp_rate/1E6)
    Thus output rate will vary from 40 ksps to 79.99 ksps
    The channel is filtered to 25.0 KHz bandwidth followed by squelch
    The squelch is non-blocking since samples will be added with other demods
    The quadrature demod is followed by a fourth stage of decimation by 4
    This brings the sample rate down to 8 ksps to 15.98 ksps
    The audio is low-pass filtered to 3.5 kHz bandwidth
    The polyphase resampler resamples by samp_rate/(decims[1] * decims[0]**3)
    Audio rate is configurable at 8 or 16 ksps
    This results in a constant 8/16 ksps, irrespective of RF sample rate
    The audio may then be CTCSS squelch blocked if configured, with a tone
    The audio may then be high-pass filtered to remove CTCSS tones if configured
    This 8/16 ksps audio stream may be added to other demod streams
    The audio is run through an additional blocking squelch at -200 dB
    This stops the sample flow so squelched audio is not recorded to file
    The wav file sink stores 8-bit samples (default/grainy quality but compact)
    Default demodulator center frequency is 0 Hz
    This is desired since hardware DC removal reduces sensitivity at 0 Hz
    WBFM demod of LO leakage will just be 0 amplitude

    Args:
        samp_rate (float): Input baseband sample rate in sps (1E6 minimum)
        audio_rate (float): Output audio sample rate in sps (8 kHz minimum)
        record (bool): Record audio to file if True
        audio_bps (int): Audio bit depth in bps (bits/samples)
        min_file_size (int): Minimum saved wav file size
        ctcss_filter (bool): Filter on set CTCSS tone if True
        ctcss_tone_block (bool): Prevent CTCSS tones in audio output if True

    Attributes:
        center_freq (float): Baseband center frequency in Hz
        record (bool): Record audio to file if True
        time_stamp (int): Time stamp of demodulator start for timing run length
        ctcss_filter (bool): Filter on set CTCSS tone if True
        ctcss_tone (float): CTCSS tone frequency for filter in Hz
        ctcss_index (int): CTCSS tone list index for selected tone
        ctcss_tone_block (bool): Prevent CTCSS tones in audio output if True
        ctcss_level (float): CTCSS tone level required to break squelch (open)
